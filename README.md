Problem Statement:

Phishing is a type of fraud in which an attacker impersonates 
a reputable company or person in order to get sensitive 
information such as login credentials or account information 
via email or other communication channels. Phishing is
popular among attackers because it is easier to persuade 
someone to click a malicious link that appears to be 
authentic than it is to break through a computer's protection 
measures.
The mail goal is to predict whether the domains are real or 
malicious
